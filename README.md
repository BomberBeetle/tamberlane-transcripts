# How to Submit Transcripts for Tamberlane

Each comic page has its own folder. If the comic page does not have a folder yet, when you click the Create File button, name the file 222/English.txt (for example.)

In the folder for that comic, create a new .txt file. Give it the name of the language as it should appear on the webpage. For example, the Spanish language file should be "Espa√±ol.txt".

Paste in the transcript.

HTML formatting is allowed. Make sure to escape any ampersands (&) with `&amp;`, less than (<) with `&lt;`, and greater than (>) with `&gt;`.
